# Anti-Theft Alarm Motion Detecting System

## Done as a Project for the Digital Signal Processing Module


The main idea of this project is that the whole system is at one place, with the ultrasonic sensor facing the door which is supposed to be observed. 
When a person enters, the door movement is recognized by the system and it turns on the yellow LED. When the person comes even closer to the system, it has a specified amount of time to enter a PIN using a remote controller. If the person doesn’t enter the correct PIN, or if they don’t manage to enter any PIN in time, the red LED lights up together with the buzzer signifying an intrusion. However, if the person manages to enter the correct PIN within the time interval, the green LED lights up and the system marks the person as someone who is authorized to be there.
